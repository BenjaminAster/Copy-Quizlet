### Copy-Quizlet

Import vocabulary from a [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com), an Excel or CSV file or from [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), edit them and export them to your own Quizlet, or to an Excel/CSV file.

Side note: I created this in November 2020 and my code back then was awful! Also, it's now possible to export a Quizlet learnset directly from Quizlet, which makes this tool kind of useless now.
